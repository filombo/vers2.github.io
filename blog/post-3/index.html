<h2 id="can-you-play-video-games-using-your-brain-as-a-controller">Can you play video games using your brain as a controller?</h2>
<p>The answer is <strong>yes</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://neuralink.com/blog/"><strong>Neuralink</strong></a>, a company founded by Elon Musk in 2016, has recently been all over the news as it has managed to do something extremely fascinating.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>they managed to get a monkey to play a video game</strong>, albeit a simple one compared to more modern video games. Well but it doesn&rsquo;t end there. In fact, the monkey has managed to play with the controller detached, <strong>only with the power of his mind</strong>.</p>
<p>How many times have your friends during the last game of the FIFA finals turned off or disconnected your controller? In a few years you will be able to say goodbye to this misfortune that punctually happens to you when you were about to score a goal.</p>
<p>Neuralink has developed a chip, called <strong>N1 Link</strong>, that has been implanted in the skull of the macaque Pager about six weeks before the shooting. After this operation Pager learned to play the famous video game Pong - for the occasion renamed <strong>MindPong</strong> - using a joystick and receiving in return a banana milkshake through a straw as a prize.</p>
<p>In this way, thanks to artificial intelligence, the <strong>1,024 electrodes</strong> of the sensor were able to &ldquo;map&rdquo; the neurons activated by the primate in correspondence of each movement, thus creating a personalized predictive model. The second and final phase saw the monkey succeed in moving the bars without the aid of the joystick, using only the <strong>wireless channel activated between the computer and its N1 Link brain chip.</strong> And the results were crazy. As you can see in the pictures, in fact, only once the ball was not successfully rejected.</p>
<p>It is expected that the first application of the Link to be computer control for people with spinal cord injury. There are many other potential future applications for the Link. These include restoring motor and sensory function and the treatment of neurological disorders.</p>
<p>The possibilities that can even be imagined are endless. Just think of the potential for even closer collaboration between man and machine. If the <strong>N1 Link</strong> could stimulate memory areas, there would be no more memory gaps, especially during tests or questions at school. If the information provided is verified, many people for whom the memory of a practice or a series of crucial steps is crucial for the success of their work would be greatly helped in the successful completion of as many tasks as possible.</p>
<p>This device could also break down communication barriers because if the Links can talk to each other, it will no longer be necessary to move your mouth to let someone know what you want to say and think.</p>
<p>Orwell said, in 1984, that the only truly free inches are those inside your skull. Will that still be true with this device? If these devices are hacked what could happen? Could an army of zombies be created that are controlled by a chip in their brain? Well, let&rsquo;s say that you could really do a lot of things, the only frontier is the imagination.</p>

<h2 id="will-the-n1-link-be-safe">Will the N1 Link be safe?</h2>
<p>Clinical trials have not yet begun to be done, and so they do not have safety data in humans. But safety has been at the core of the design process. In particular, the Link includes technical innovations for improving the safety of the surgical procedure compared to existing BMI devices or traditional neurosurgery. Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>There is always risk associated with general anesthesia, and that risk is reduced by shortening the time of the procedure. The Neurosurgical Robot is capable of efficient and reliable electrode insertion. Also, the robot is being designed to insert threads through a hole in the skull as small as 23 mm diameter. Combined with other advancements in robotic surgical tooling, this may allow them to eliminate general anesthesia and to implant the device under conscious sedation.</p>
<p>Inserting a device into the brain always carries some risk of bleeding.They are trying to reduce that risk by using micron-scale threads, inserted with a needle whose diameter is about the size of many neurons in the brain. Furthermore, because each thread is individually inserted, they are designing the Neurosurgical Robot to avoid damaging blood vessels at or near the surface of the brain.</p>
